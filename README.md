Project Title: Sparta tic tac toe

Was asked to deliver a website with a script which will allow the css and html provided to function like a
TicTacToe game. Pulled through the tasks and created an MVP that allows 2 users to play this game and declare a winner

By the end the user journey ends, they are expected to have enjoyed the game built and have the choice to either come back for more
or leave the site!

Getting Started Feel free to download or clone the project from https://github.com/hMavrokefalidis/sparta-tic-tac-toe and deploy it simply by opening the .html files to your explorer

Functionalities: interactive buttons with built in turn system which allows Xs and Os to show up and finally declare the game won once 3 of them have been lined up

Built With JavaScrip (with JQuery)
